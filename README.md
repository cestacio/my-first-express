## index.js Mini MIDDLEWARE excercise
Requirements:
Take the phrase: "I <3 JavaScript" (or any three-word phrase).
The endpoint /phrase  should print this string.
However, the string is built using four handlers!
The first handler should add a "phrase" key to the "request" object along with the first word and pass it along.
The second handler should add the second word to the "phrase" key of the "request" object and pass it along.
The third handler should add the third word to the "phrase" key of the "request" object and pass it along.
The fourth handler should issue the complete "request.phrase" response, without adding anything to the "request" object at all.

example:   GET   /phrase   --> "I <3 JavaScript"
